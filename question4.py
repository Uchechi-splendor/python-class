# Ask the user to enter a number

# In this program:

# The is_prime function is defined to check if a given number is prime. It returns True if the number is prime and False otherwise.
# The user is prompted to enter a number using the input() function.
# The user input is converted to an integer and passed to the is_prime function to determine if it is prime.
# Based on the result returned by the is_prime function, the program prints whether the entered number is prime or not.
